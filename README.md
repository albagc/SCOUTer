# Simulate Controlled OUTliers - SCOUTer

SCOUTer is a set of functions that open the door towards a new way of 
simulating outliers. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a base 
model, SCOUTer enables the user to control exactly how the simulated 
outliers will be.

This is possible by controlling the pair of properties that define 
outliers: the Squared Prediction Error (_SPE_) and the Hotelling's T^2. 
By setting the desired target values to these statistics, the user can 
obtain *all* types of outliers.
 
Control your simulations with SCOUTer in an *easy and interactive* way.

Type: 
'help <function_name>' 
in Matlab command window to get more information about <function_name>.m.
Check _MatlabDocu.pdf_ with all the documentation about the functions in SCOUTer Matlab version.
